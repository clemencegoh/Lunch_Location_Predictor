# Lunch_Location_Predictor
Lunch Location Predictor service in python, 
using machine learning to predict the next day's lunch 
location of choice

## Implementation specifics
* Initial Idea:
    * Use Random forest to predict


## TODO:
- [ ] Encode all data into one-hot vectors
- [ ] Establish baseline accuracy 
- [ ] Write code for train and validate/test
- [ ] Write code for prediction based off model
- [ ] Integrate such that one function call with a new datapoint re-trains the model and predicts based off the new model
